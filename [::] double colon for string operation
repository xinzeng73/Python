::
[start:stop:step]
if step is negative with "-", then from reverse order
so, [::-1] will give totally reversed string



>>> s='1234567890'
>>> s[::2]
'13579'
>>> s[::3]
'1470'
>>> s[0::3]
'1470'
>>> s[1::3]
'258'
>>> s[1:4:3]
'2'
>>> s[1:8:3]
'258'
>>> s[1:7:3]
'25'
>>> 
>>> 
>>> s[6::2]
'79'
>>> s[::-1]
'0987654321'
>>> s[::-2]
'08642'
>>> s[5::-2]
'642'
